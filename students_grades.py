# You should create a script that will help this school organizing their students and their respective grades;
# Here is the list of students and their grades:

class_name = "bellsworth wiston school - second grade b"

students = ["dave braninghan", "susan goodwin",
            "adam lowel", "linda lydon", "jessie boham"]

# Below you can find lists with their grades for each trimester

dave_braninghan_grades = [10.0, 9.2, 8.5, 7.0]
susan_goodwin_grades = [7.0, 8.5, 6.0, 10.0]
adam_lowel_grades = [6.0, 6.0, 8.5, 5.0]
linda_lydon_grades = [9.5, 10.0, 10.0, 5.5]
jessie_boham_grades = [10.0, 3.5, 7.75, 9.0]

# ITERATION 1
# As you can see, the student names are not in order. Look for a Python attribute you can use to sort the students names in alphabetical order.
# Use a print once you do that just to make sure that the names were correctly ordered.
# Once that is done and verified, you can comment out the print
# Your code goes below this line


# ITERATION 2
# We currently have all the grades for each student. Calculate the avarage grade for each student and store the result in a variable.
# Your code goes below this line


# ITERATION 3
# Print a message for each student saying "Hellow *Student Name*. Your final grade this year is *Avarage Grade*"
# As you can see, the student's names are not capitalized and that's just rude. Make sure when you print them, their first letters are capitalized.
# Your code goes below this line


# ITERATION 4
# Now, store all the student's avarage grades inside a new list that we will use to calculate the entire class avarage.
# TIP: you can store variables in a list.
# Once you have a list with all students avarage grades, calculate the entire class avarage.
# Your code goes below this line


# ITERATION 5
# Calculate how many students are in this class using a Python function and store it on a variable
# Print a message stating what was the avarage class grade and how many students were in the class.
# The message should have the class name and it should be ALL IN CAPITAL LETTERS.


# BONUS ITERATION
# Now, if you are feeling courageous, we can go a step ahead and create a function with a conditional
# If the student had an average grade higher than 7, print a message that have made it to the next grade.
# If their grade is lower than 7, they have not made it and will have to go through second grade again.
# I can help you on this one! =)
